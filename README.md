# Mate-Yehuda-veterans

### About the Project
We are software engineering students at the Azrieli College of Engineering in Jerusalem.
This project was developed as part of the academic requirements for two courses:
"Software Project Management and Planning" and "Software Engineering in the Community."
The system we developed is a web-based management platform for the day center "Vatikey Mateh Yehuda", an organization serving senior citizens in the Mateh Yehuda region.
The association strives to improve the quality of life of the elderly and to expand the variety of services and activities available to them.
Until now, the center's operations were managed manually, making daily management, documentation, and organization more difficult.
To address this need, we developed a dedicated, interactive web-based system for the center’s staff.

#### The system includes:
1. Management of individual profiles for each participant
2. Daily attendance tracking
3.  Transportation scheduling
4. Report generation
5.  Additional tools for managing day-to-day operations

#### Technologies Used:

1. React for building the user interface
2.  Firebase for authentication, file storage, and database management
3.  Material UI for designing a responsive and accessible UI
The system was built with an emphasis on usability and efficiency, enabling the staff to focus on their mission of serving the elderly community — with the help of smart and streamlined management tools.
